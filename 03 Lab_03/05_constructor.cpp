/*
Create a C++ class called 'Person' with a constructor that initializes the name and 
age member variables. Implement a copy constructor that creates a new Person object 
by copying the name and age from an existing object. Show the usage of both constructors 
by creating an object named 'person1' with name 'Sunil' and age 25. Then, use the constructors 
to create another object named 'person2' with the same name and age as 'person1'. 
Print the details (name and age) of 'person2'.
